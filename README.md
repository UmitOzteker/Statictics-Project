This project is a comprehensive toolkit for statistical analysis and data exploration, developed by Umit Ozteker. It provides a wide range of tools and scripts for performing statistical computations,[...]


## Features ‚ú®

  * **Descriptive Statistics**: Compute measures like mean, median, mode, standard deviation, and quartiles to summarize your data.
  * **Hypothesis Testing**: Conduct statistical tests such as t-tests, chi-square tests, and ANOVA to validate hypotheses.
  * **Regression Analysis**: Implement **linear**, **multiple**, and **logistic regression** models to understand variable relationships.
  * **Data Visualization**: Generate a variety of plots, including **histograms**, **box plots**, **scatter plots**, and **heatmaps**, using libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn.
  * **Data Preprocessing**: Use tools for cleaning, normalizing, and transforming datasets to prepare them for analysis.
  * **Time Series Analysis**: Analyze temporal data with tools for trend detection, seasonality, and forecasting.
  * **Probability Distributions**: Explore and visualize common statistical distributions like normal, binomial, and Poisson distributions.
  * **Interactive Dashboards**: Create dynamic visualizations with Jupyter widgets or Plotly for interactive data exploration.
  * **Outlier Detection**: Identify and handle outliers using statistical methods like Z-score and the Interquartile Range (**IQR**).
  * **Correlation Analysis**: Calculate and visualize correlation matrices to understand the relationships between variables.
  * **Customizable Workflows**: The modular structure allows you to easily tailor analysis pipelines to specific datasets.
  * **Sample Datasets**: The project includes various example datasets to demonstrate script functionality and aid learning.
